        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Jamie Li. I grew up in a low-income household in Northern California. Growing up with the opportunity my parents never had and had given me, I learned to be appreciative. I try to give back to the community every chance I get. I have participated in countless hours of volunteering in my community. For example, I have helped distribute food to low-income families at my local church, raise money to my local non-profit organization that aims to address poverty in the community, and assist the library in bringing the community together through events that welcome people of all ages and backgrounds. <br><br>

        Most of my experience comes from volunteering at my local library. I have been involved with helping out at the library even since I was young. During the school year, I would find myself going to the library after class to attend meetings held by a group that primarily organized events for children and even teenagers. One of the main events that we organized each year to raise money for the library was a talent show that displayed secret hidden talents of our fellow community. This event required a collective teamwork between a group of ambitious hard working young adults to run smoothly. My job was to recruit talented young children to perform and find sponsorships for the talent show. During the summer, I would volunteer to help with a program that encouraged children to read for fun and write book reports. My job was primarily to engage with the child to ensure that they read their books and were rewarded for it. Even to this day, I try to lend a helping hand whenever I get the chance to. My collective experience with working at the library has made me come to realize that I enjoy working with young children. <br><br>

        I am currently a fourth year undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside. I am working towards a Bachelor degree in Psychology. The workings of the brain and why humans behave the way they do is quite fascinating. With a deeper knowledge of complexity of human beings, I plan to get a Masters degree in the near future to achieve my goals of becoming a Speech Pathologist. I would be able to work with adults as well as young children with communication disorders. The ability to help all those of all ages struggle to make their voice heard precisely and fluently will make me live life with meaning.
